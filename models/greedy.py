    --- Greedy optimization algorithm ---
    This file contains the general greedy optimization algorithm framework for graph clustering and community detection tasks.
    According to loss/likelihood functions, iterative algorithms are used to optimize the objective function.
    For example: Louvain algorithm is a popular greedy algorithm for community detection.
